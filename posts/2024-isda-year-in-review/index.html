Our aim is to serve 100,000 farmers, bringing data-driven agricultural solutions to even more communities. We plan to enhance our services by extending the image-based pest and disease diagnosis feature to cover all crops and expanding our crop portfolio based on farmer demand.</p><p>Additionally, we aim to introduce weather-dependent planting and top-dressing advisories, helping farmers make even more precise, climate-informed decisions. With plans to expand to more countries, we are excited to scale our efforts and continue empowering smallholder farmers across Africa.</p><p> </p><h3 id=2024-reflections-from-our-ceo><strong>2024 Reflections from Our CEO</strong></h3><p> </p><p>&ldquo;For iSDA it&rsquo;s been a quite incredible year. We began the year with a belief that the latest developments in AI could represent a true game changing opportunity for low cost digital agronomic extension for African farmers. We also had many questions given the approach was so new. Can it work at real scale or is it a novelty? Will the yield improvements we&rsquo;d demonstrated in field trials translate to similar improvements in real world use? Is the technology affordable enough to work for African smallholders?</p><p>From our public launch in March 2024 we quickly gathered interest from farmers and by mid-year had over 10,000 plots registered, mapped and provided individually tailored nutrient plans. This was far faster adoption than expected and gave us hope we were onto something. Some in the team had wondered if farmers would adopt WhatsApp for this kind of use - rather than family and neighbourhood gossip - and this milestone gave us confidence.</p><p>As our first cohort of farmers using the system, around 3000 maize farmers in Bulambuli, Uganda, reached harvest, we were anxious to see their results. Sampling showed an average yield increase of 66% compared with nearest neighbours using the typical practice for the area, consistent with the roughly 50% increase in yield across field crops we had demonstrated in previous trials.</p><p>On the technology side our digital team optimised our systems throughout the year, which along with cost improvements such as cheaper large language models developed by OpenAI and others dropped our technology running costs significantly. These costs will fluctuate as new features such as voice and video become possible, while computers and AI models get cheaper and cheaper, but we have demonstrated that our system can be 10x cheaper than traditional agronomic extension.</p><p>We end the year having gone from a standing start to helping farmers on over 30,000 plots increase their yields and livelihoods, and as we go into the new year I look forward to scaling to 100,000 farmers or more in 2025. We now have a proven system, ready to use for major field crops and able to be rapidly calibrated for new regions and crops. My biggest hope is that having demonstrated the potential we can now put our technology into the hands of partners who are already serving farmers to scale their impact and reach. Our whole team is excited for this journey!&rdquo;</p><p><strong>-Jamie Collinson, iSDA CEO</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>2024 has been a year of milestones and meaningful impact for iSDA and our Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service. From working with over 30,000 farmers, to launching innovative features and forming strategic partnerships, every achievement this year has strengthened our commitment to transforming agriculture in Africa.</p><p>The testimonies from farmers, coupled with measurable improvements in yields and profitability, have underscored the value of data-driven, tailored solutions in addressing the challenges faced by smallholder farmers. This year’s events, collaborations, and on-the-ground interactions have provided not only validation of our work but also inspiration to continue refining and expanding Virtual Agronomist to meet the diverse needs of the farming communities in Africa.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><a href=/posts/>To read about our 2024 key events and moments in detail, click here.</a></p><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/68876954/>Follow our latest updates on LinkedIn here.</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class="pt-7 pt-md-10 bg-light"><div class=container><div class="row align-items-center mb-5"><div class="col-12 col-md"><h3 class=mb-0>Latest Stories</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">Here’s what we've been up to recently.</p></div><div class="col-12 col-md-auto"><a href=/posts class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-gray-300 d-none d-md-inline">View all</a></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex mb-5"><div class="card mb-6 mb-lg-0 shadow-light-lg lift lift-lg"><a class=card-img-top href=/posts/2024-isda-year-in-review/><img src=/img/events/2024-review_hu_9e53db3ca5281181.webp srcset="/img/events/2024-review_hu_1aad2848176726ba.webp 2x, /img/events/2024-review_hu_9e53db3ca5281181.webp 1x" class=card-img-top><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-white"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 480" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M2160 0C1440 240 720 240 720 240H0v240h2880V0h-720z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=card-body href=/posts/2024-isda-year-in-review/><h3>2024 in Review: Celebrating a Year of Milestones and Impact</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">As 2024 comes to an end, our team at iSDA are proud to look back on a year marked by progress, …</p></a><a class="card-meta mt-auto" href=/posts/2024-isda-year-in-review/><hr class=card-meta-divider><p class="h6 text-uppercase text-muted mb-0 ms-auto"><time datetime=2019-05-02>December 19, 2024</time></p></a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex mb-5"><div class="card mb-6 mb-lg-0 shadow-light-lg lift lift-lg"><a class=card-img-top href=/posts/virtual-agronomist-at-cpcn-seminar-2024/><img src=/img/events/cpcn-seminar_hu_b21d193f1cb1d8e6.webp srcset="/img/events/cpcn-seminar_hu_1eaa0e134c3e76f6.webp 2x, /img/events/cpcn-seminar_hu_b21d193f1cb1d8e6.webp 1x" class=card-img-top><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-white"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 480" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M2160 0C1440 240 720 240 720 240H0v240h2880V0h-720z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=card-body href=/posts/virtual-agronomist-at-cpcn-seminar-2024/><h3>Virtual Agronomist at the CPCN Seminar: Revolutionising Agronomic Advice for Farmers Across Africa</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">In a world where smallholder farmers face increasing challenges in achieving sustainable …</p></a><a class="card-meta mt-auto" href=/posts/virtual-agronomist-at-cpcn-seminar-2024/><hr class=card-meta-divider><p class="h6 text-uppercase text-muted mb-0 ms-auto"><time datetime=2019-05-02>December 13, 2024</time></p></a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex mb-5"><div class="card mb-6 mb-lg-0 shadow-light-lg lift lift-lg"><a class=card-img-top href=/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/><img src=/img/events/afcpa-header_hu_d76f0a6d5d9924d3.webp srcset="/img/events/afcpa-header_hu_5649eb4e3ac75224.webp 2x, /img/events/afcpa-header_hu_d76f0a6d5d9924d3.webp 1x" class=card-img-top><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-white"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 480" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M2160 0C1440 240 720 240 720 240H0v240h2880V0h-720z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=card-body href=/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/><h3>Showcasing Virtual Agronomist at the 3rd African Conference on Precision Agriculture</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">We were thrilled to make a significant impact at the 3rd African Conference of Precision Agriculture …</p></a><a class="card-meta mt-auto" href=/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/><hr class=card-meta-divider><p class="h6 text-uppercase text-muted mb-0 ms-auto"><time datetime=2019-05-02>December 6, 2024</time></p></a></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-gray-100"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 48" fill="none"><path d="M0 48h2880V0h-720C1442.5 52 720 0 720 0H0v48z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div><footer class="py-8 py-md-11" style=background-color:#ebe9ea><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-lg-3 pb-5"><a href=/><img src=/iSDA_Logo_Master_Pos_RGB.svg alt=... class="footer-brand img-fluid mb-2 w-25 d-lg-none">
