However, challenges such as resource inefficiencies, soil degradation, and the need for precise farming practices make it difficult to meet growing demands sustainably.</p><p>To tackle these issues, our team at iSDA conducted a rice harvest survey in late 2024 following the introduction of <a href=/virtual-agronomist/>Virtual Agronomist</a>, our AI advisory tool. Designed to deliver tailored, data-driven recommendations, this technology aims to enhance farming practices and boost productivity. The survey assessed its impact on farmers&rsquo; methods, productivity, and livelihoods.</p><p>The findings not only highlight the potential of Virtual Agronomist to transform farming in Mwea but also provide valuable insights for future improvements and scaling the technology to benefit more communities. This initiative reflects our commitment to equipping farmers with the tools they need for sustainable, high-yield agriculture.</p><p> </p><h3 id=rice-farming-in-mwea><strong>Rice Farming in Mwea</strong></h3><p> </p><p>Agriculture is crucial to Kenya&rsquo;s economy, <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/kenya-agribusiness#:~:text=Overview,underdeveloped%20supporting%20infrastructure%20and%20institutions">contributing to about 33% of Kenya&rsquo;s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and accounting for 40% of the overall workforce in the country</a>. Key agricultural products include tea, coffee, maize, sugarcane, and horticultural crops, with the country also being a major exporter of fresh produce like mangoes, onions, and cabbages. Rice production in Mwea is especially important, as it <a href="https://www.presidentiallibrary.go.ke/node/103#:~:text=/%207%20July%202022%20/%200%20Comments,country%27s%20freedom%20from%20colonial%20rule">supplies over 80% of Kenya&rsquo;s rice</a>.</p><p>Despite its significance, rice farming in Mwea faces challenges such as soil degradation, water scarcity, pests, and diseases. These issues, worsened by climate change, hinder productivity and sustainability. Additionally, many farmers lack access to reliable agronomic knowledge, making it difficult to optimise their farming practices.</p><p> </p><p><img src=/img/virtual_agronomist/mugo-and-team_hu16036943799077019234.png srcset="/img/virtual_agronomist/mugo-and-team_hu1903894704230564727.png 2x, /img/virtual_agronomist/mugo-and-team_hu16036943799077019234.png 1x" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5" alt="Our iSDA team with Mwea rice farmer Mugo who used our Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service this season"><div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 text-center"><p style=font-size:13px><em>Members of our iSDA team with Mwea rice farmer Mugo who used our Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service this season</em></p></div></div></p><p> </p><p>To help address these challenges, our team at iSDA introduced Virtual Agronomist to farmers in Mwea. Our tool provides tailored recommendations using machine learning and remote sensing technologies. It offers insights on crucial agronomic practices including managing soil health, fertiliser use, pest control, and harvest monitoring, empowering farmers to make better-informed decisions. By bridging the gap between traditional farming practices and modern technology, through Virtual Agronomist, we aim to improve productivity and resilience in Mwea’s rice farming communities.</p><p> </p><h3 id=key-findings-from-the-survey><strong>Key Findings from the Survey</strong></h3><p> </p><h4 id=tailored-advice--improved-farming-practices><strong>Tailored Advice & Improved Farming Practices</strong></h4><p> </p><p>One of Virtual Agronomist’s standout features is its ability to adapt recommendations to the unique soil properties of different regions. Soil analysis from <a href=/isdasoil/>iSDAsoil</a> revealed that Mwea’s soil contains naturally high potassium levels. To prevent crop and soil damage from excess potassium, Virtual Agronomist recommended reducing potassium-based fertiliser applications for farmers.</p><p>Additionally, the tool advised splitting the application of top-dressing fertilisers into two stages rather than a single dose, aligning with the crop&rsquo;s nutrient uptake needs. This strategy not only optimised nutrient use but also significantly reduced overall fertiliser consumption. Farmers using Virtual Agronomist <strong>cut their fertiliser use by 20%</strong>, reducing the average number of bags per hectare per season from 10 (used by non-Virtual Agronomist farmers) to 8 (used by Virtual Agronomist farmers). These adjustments resulted in both economic and environmental benefits, reducing costs for farmers while promoting sustainable fertiliser use.</p><p> </p><p><img src=/img/virtual_agronomist/fertiliser-results-mwea_hu15928691244261474526.png srcset="/img/virtual_agronomist/fertiliser-results-mwea_hu2551387607866200792.png 2x, /img/virtual_agronomist/fertiliser-results-mwea_hu15928691244261474526.png 1x" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5" alt="Graph demonstrating 20% reduction in costly fertiliser consumption for Mwea rice farmers who applied Virtual Agronomist recommendations."><div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 text-center"><p style=font-size:13px><em>Graph demonstrating 20% reduction in costly fertiliser consumption for Mwea rice farmers who applied Virtual Agronomist recommendations</em></p></div></div></p><p> </p><p>Farmers who used Virtual Agronomist were guided to apply balanced fertilisers at the start of the season, ensuring the inclusion of all three critical nutrients: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK). This approach contrasted sharply with the practices of many farmers who did not use the service. Among non-users, approximately 20% applied only phosphate (Triple Super Phosphate - TSP) and potassium (Muriate of Potash - MOP) fertilisers at the start, neglecting nitrogen, which is crucial for early crop growth. Even more concerning, some non-users applied fertilisers that provided only a single nutrient, such as phosphorus or potassium. Additionally, 3% of these farmers applied only potassium during the top-dressing phase, depriving the rice crop of the nitrogen it critically needs during its vegetative stage.</p><p>The survey highlights how Virtual Agronomist’s tailored recommendations are transforming farming practices in Mwea, equipping farmers with the knowledge and tools to achieve higher productivity while minimising input waste and environmental impact.</p><p> </p><h4 id=productivity-gains-lower-costs-and-higher-profits><strong>Productivity Gains, Lower Costs and Higher Profits</strong></h4><p> </p><p>The implementation of Virtual Agronomist in Mwea yielded remarkable results, demonstrating its potential to transform rice farming. Our survey found that farmers who adopted the tool experienced an impressive <strong>17% increase in yields</strong> compared to those who did not use the service. This boost in productivity was linked to the adoption of good agronomic practices, such as balanced fertiliser application and optimised resource use, as guided by Virtual Agronomist.</p><p> </p><p><img src=/img/virtual_agronomist/yield-results-mwea_hu10208156662199752865.png srcset="/img/virtual_agronomist/yield-results-mwea_hu4917397564486814993.png 2x, /img/virtual_agronomist/yield-results-mwea_hu10208156662199752865.png 1x" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5" alt="Graph demonstrating 17% increase in yield for Mwea rice farmers who used Virtual Agronomist recommendations."><div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 text-center"><p style=font-size:13px><em>Graph demonstrating 17% increase in yield for Mwea rice farmers who used Virtual Agronomist recommendations</em></p></div></div></p><p> </p><p>One of the most significant benefits of the tool was the reduction in input costs. By providing precise recommendations tailored to each farm’s soil and crop conditions, Virtual Agronomist helped farmers <strong>cut operational costs by 22%</strong>, primarily through reduced fertiliser usage. This reduction in input costs, coupled with increased yields, translated into substantial profit gains. On average, farmers who utilised Virtual Agronomist saw their <strong>total profits rise by 36%</strong> — a testament to our tool’s ability to drive both economic and agronomic improvements.</p><p> </p><p><img src=/img/virtual_agronomist/profit-results-mwea_hu5524909551192691953.png srcset="/img/virtual_agronomist/profit-results-mwea_hu8859446085880536527.png 2x, /img/virtual_agronomist/profit-results-mwea_hu5524909551192691953.png 1x" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5" alt="Graph demonstrating 36% increase in profits for Mwea rice farmers who used Virtual Agronomist recommendations."><div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 text-center"><p style=font-size:13px><em>Graph demonstrating 36% increase in profits for Mwea rice farmers who used Virtual Agronomist recommendations</em></p></div></div></p><p> </p><p>These findings highlight how Virtual Agronomist is not only helping farmers achieve better productivity but also enabling them to lower costs and enhance profitability, ensuring a more sustainable and resilient farming system in Mwea.</p><p> </p><h4 id=farmer-adoption-rates><strong>Farmer Adoption Rates</strong></h4><p> </p><p>Although Virtual Agronomist was introduced to a small subset of Mwea’s rice growers, its impact was substantial and indicative of its potential for wider adoption. Our team at iSDA worked with 336 farmers within the scheme - a fraction of Mwea’s estimated 14,000 rice producers. Despite the limited initial rollout, the engagement levels among participating farmers were exceptionally high.</p><p> </p><p><img src=/img/virtual_agronomist/lucy-and-team_hu6814780181964533693.png srcset="/img/virtual_agronomist/lucy-and-team_hu10836278535995205958.png 2x, /img/virtual_agronomist/lucy-and-team_hu6814780181964533693.png 1x" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5" alt="iSDA's Paul Chunga, Tume Elema, Abi Wairimu and Patrick Wanyaka reviewing rice crops with non-Virtual Agronomist farmer Lucy."><div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 text-center"><p style=font-size:13px><em>iSDA's Paul Chunga, Tume Elema, Abi Wairimu and Patrick Wanyaka reviewing rice crops with non-Virtual Agronomist farmer Lucy</em></p></div></div></p><p> </p><p>Farmers who used Virtual Agronomist actively followed the tool’s advisories, particularly its fertiliser recommendations, which played a key role in improving farming practices and boosting productivity. The success of the service among these early adopters has sparked significant interest across the wider farming community in Mwea. Many farmers who were not part of the initial group are now requesting access to the tool, reflecting growing awareness of its benefits and a strong demand for its expansion.</p><p>These findings underscore the importance of scaling Virtual Agronomist to reach more farmers in Mwea and beyond, highlighting its potential to drive positive change across Kenya’s agricultural landscape.</p><p> </p><h4 id=sustainability-impact><strong>Sustainability Impact</strong></h4><p> </p><p>Our survey revealed critical insights into the sustainability challenges and practices among rice farmers in Mwea, highlighting areas for improvement and long-term resilience.</p><p>One key finding centred on water usage, a significant factor influencing productivity in the region. Changes in rainfall and weather patterns have led to intermittent rains, often causing droughts that necessitate irrigation to supplement water for rice crops. Approximately 10% of the farmers identified water scarcity as a major challenge affecting their yields. Other sustainability challenges reported included pests—particularly birds, rats, and snails—as well as diseases like rice blasts, which were cited by the majority of farmers.</p><p> </p><p><img src=/img/virtual_agronomist/pest-results-mwea_hu12138049469847335868.png srcset="/img/virtual_agronomist/pest-results-mwea_hu18055674522410597221.png 2x, /img/virtual_agronomist/pest-results-mwea_hu12138049469847335868.png 1x" class="img-fluid rounded shadow mt-5" alt="Graph demonstrating sustainability challenges faced by Mwea rice farmers during the season."><div class="row justify-content-center mt-3"><div class="col-12 col-md-10 col-lg-8 text-center"><p style=font-size:13px><em>Graph demonstrating sustainability challenges faced by Mwea rice farmers during the season</em></p></div></div></p><p> </p><p>In terms of soil health, the survey revealed a promising trend. Among the farmers interviewed, 50% reported using manure to enrich their soils, with 60% of these manure users being Virtual Agronomist adopters. This indicates that the tool is encouraging practices that improve soil fertility, reflecting its broader influence on promoting sustainable agronomic practices.</p><p>These findings highlight the critical need to address water management challenges, control pests and diseases, and encourage sustainable farming practices to boost productivity and strengthen resilience in Mwea. Virtual Agronomist has proven its ability to steer farmers toward more sustainable approaches, paving the way for lasting agricultural and environmental improvements.</p><p> </p><h3 id=broader-implications-and-lessons-learned><strong>Broader Implications and Lessons Learned</strong></h3><p> </p><p>The success of Virtual Agronomist in Mwea holds significant potential for scaling the technology to other regions and crops across Kenya and beyond. With <strong>over 90% of Mwea farmers eager to continue using the tool in the coming season</strong>, our team at iSDA is in a prime position to expand its reach and impact. The positive feedback from Mwea farmers, combined with the demonstrated improvements in yield, resource efficiency, and sustainability, sets the stage for broader adoption of Virtual Agronomist.

Through these partnerships, the reach and impact of Virtual Agronomist can be further expanded, leading to more resilient and productive farming communities across Kenya and beyond.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The Mwea harvest survey highlighted the positive impact of our Virtual Agronomist service on farming. By offering tailored soil-based recommendations, the tool helped farmers reduce fertiliser use, cutting costs and benefiting the environment. Users of Virtual Agronomist also managed fertilisers better, resulting in healthier crops and higher yields. Non-users, however, often applied fertilisers incorrectly, which hurt their crop growth.</p><p>Over 90% of Virtual Agronomist users in Mwea were satisfied and plan to keep using it, while many non-users showed interest in adopting the service. This shows the potential to expand Virtual Agronomist to other regions and crops, helping farmers boost productivity, save costs, and adopt sustainable practices.</p><p>The success in Mwea highlights the need for advanced agronomic tools to address farming challenges and improve yields. We call on governments, NGOs, agribusinesses, and development partners to support these tools’ widespread adoption across Africa, empowering farmers and promoting sustainable agriculture to ensure food security across the continent.</p><p> </p><p><a href=/virtual-agronomist/>To learn more about Virtual Agronomist, click here.</a></p><p><a href=/isdasoil/>Find out more information on iSDAsoil here.</a></p><p><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/company/68876954/>Follow our latest updates on LinkedIn here.</a></p></div></div></div></section><section class="pt-7 pt-md-10 bg-light"><div class=container><div class="row align-items-center mb-5"><div class="col-12 col-md"><h3 class=mb-0>Latest Stories</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">Here’s what we've been up to recently.</p></div><div class="col-12 col-md-auto"><a href=/posts class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-gray-300 d-none d-md-inline">View all</a></div></div><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex mb-5"><div class="card mb-6 mb-lg-0 shadow-light-lg lift lift-lg"><a class=card-img-top href=/posts/unveiling-the-impact-of-isda-rice-harvest-data-survey-in-mwea/><img src=/img/events/mwea-survey_hu3801168901659759301.webp srcset="/img/events/mwea-survey_hu14284404548303974114.webp 2x, /img/events/mwea-survey_hu3801168901659759301.webp 1x" class=card-img-top><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-white"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 480" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M2160 0C1440 240 720 240 720 240H0v240h2880V0h-720z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=card-body href=/posts/unveiling-the-impact-of-isda-rice-harvest-data-survey-in-mwea/><h3>Unveiling the Impact of iSDA's Rice Harvest Data Survey in Mwea, Kenya</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">Rice production is central to Mwea’s agricultural identity, contributing significantly to Kenya’s …</p></a><a class="card-meta mt-auto" href=/posts/unveiling-the-impact-of-isda-rice-harvest-data-survey-in-mwea/><hr class=card-meta-divider><p class="h6 text-uppercase text-muted mb-0 ms-auto"><time datetime=2019-05-02>January 17, 2025</time></p></a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex mb-5"><div class="card mb-6 mb-lg-0 shadow-light-lg lift lift-lg"><a class=card-img-top href=/posts/2024-isda-year-in-review/><img src=/img/events/2024-review_hu6951408649583385278.webp srcset="/img/events/2024-review_hu3462347672927998830.webp 2x, /img/events/2024-review_hu6951408649583385278.webp 1x" class=card-img-top><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-white"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 480" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M2160 0C1440 240 720 240 720 240H0v240h2880V0h-720z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=card-body href=/posts/2024-isda-year-in-review/><h3>2024 in Review: Celebrating a Year of Milestones and Impact</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">As 2024 comes to an end, our team at iSDA are proud to look back on a year marked by progress, …</p></a><a class="card-meta mt-auto" href=/posts/2024-isda-year-in-review/><hr class=card-meta-divider><p class="h6 text-uppercase text-muted mb-0 ms-auto"><time datetime=2019-05-02>December 19, 2024</time></p></a></div></div><div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4 d-flex mb-5"><div class="card mb-6 mb-lg-0 shadow-light-lg lift lift-lg"><a class=card-img-top href=/posts/virtual-agronomist-at-cpcn-seminar-2024/><img src=/img/events/cpcn-seminar_hu14121487098090707089.webp srcset="/img/events/cpcn-seminar_hu10585779561860660967.webp 2x, /img/events/cpcn-seminar_hu14121487098090707089.webp 1x" class=card-img-top><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-white"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 480" fill="none"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M2160 0C1440 240 720 240 720 240H0v240h2880V0h-720z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div></a><a class=card-body href=/posts/virtual-agronomist-at-cpcn-seminar-2024/><h3>Virtual Agronomist at the CPCN Seminar: Revolutionising Agronomic Advice for Farmers Across Africa</h3><p class="mb-0 text-muted">In a world where smallholder farmers face increasing challenges in achieving sustainable …</p></a><a class="card-meta mt-auto" href=/posts/virtual-agronomist-at-cpcn-seminar-2024/><hr class=card-meta-divider><p class="h6 text-uppercase text-muted mb-0 ms-auto"><time datetime=2019-05-02>December 13, 2024</time></p></a></div></div></div></div></section></div><div class=position-relative><div class="shape shape-bottom shape-fluid-x text-gray-100"><svg viewBox="0 0 2880 48" fill="none"><path d="M0 48h2880V0h-720C1442.5 52 720 0 720 0H0v48z" fill="currentcolor"/></svg></div></div><footer class="py-8 py-md-11" style=background-color:#ebe9ea><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-12 col-lg-3 pb-5"><a href=/><img src=/iSDA_Logo_Master_Pos_RGB.svg alt=... class="footer-brand img-fluid mb-2 w-25 d-lg-none">
