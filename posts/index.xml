could have a personalised, season-long advisory service in their pocket - no matter where they live, what they grow, or how much land they have?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just over a year and a half later, more than 250,000 smallholder farmers across seven
African countries have used Virtual Agronomist to register and manage over 350,000 plots.
And in the year ahead, we are on track to reach half a million farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>“I Can Now Do Agri-Business the Right Way”: Farmers Turning Virtual Agronomist Advice Into Income</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/advice-into-income/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 15:30:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/advice-into-income/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Smallholder farmers are the backbone of African agriculture, producing over 80% of the continent’s food.
Yet despite their hard work, many struggle to earn a decent income. Poor soils, expensive
fertilisers and limited access to expert advice mean that effort doesn’t always translate into profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="virtual-agronomist"&gt;Virtual Agronomist&lt;/a&gt; is changing that. Our science-backed, AI-powered advisory tool delivers
personalised, expert guidance via WhatsApp, helping farmers not just grow more, but earn more.
Already in use by over &lt;strong&gt;250,000 farmers across 350,000+ farm plots&lt;/strong&gt;, Virtual Agronomist is turning
subsistence into scale — boosting yields (by &lt;strong&gt;1.6x&lt;/strong&gt; on average), increasing incomes and creating opportunities
for long-term investment. And it’s doing so at a &lt;strong&gt;tenth of the cost&lt;/strong&gt; of traditional extension.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A month of momentum for Virtual Agronomist and a look ahead to COP30</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/month-of-momentum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:01:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/month-of-momentum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Bruce Kisitu, Director of Operations, Africa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past month has been one of the most energising periods I’ve experienced in my time with iSDA. In the space of just a few weeks we had the privilege of engaging with some of the most important conversations shaping the future of African agriculture, while also witnessing the ever-growing tangible impact of our work on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Africa Food Systems Forum in Dakar, the energy in meeting rooms, panel discussions and exhibition halls was palpable. The urgency around food security, resilience and inclusive growth could not have been clearer. iSDA was proud to contribute a science-driven, tech perspective, demonstrating that scalable digital solutions are not a distant possibility - they are happening today. Our AI-advisory tool, Virtual Agronomist, has already been adopted by over 250,000 smallholder farmers, and, in recent weeks we have been seeing an extraordinary surge of around 4,000 new registrations every single day! These numbers are not just statistics - they represent households making more informed decisions, fields being managed with greater precision and harvests that have a better chance of withstanding climate uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Agronomists Can Teach AI — An Interview with Dr. Paul Chunga</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/paul-chunga-interview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 10:22:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/paul-chunga-interview/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is often hailed as the future of farming. But without real agronomy - the science of crops, soils and farming systems - AI is just numbers. At iSDA, agronomists like Dr. Paul Chunga are making sure that Virtual Agronomist doesn’t just crunch data, but delivers advice that actually works for farmers in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Malawian agronomist with nearly a decade in CGIAR institutions, a PhD in agronomy and applied plant physiology, and now Senior Agronomist at iSDA, Dr. Chunga has dedicated his career to bridging science and practice. We spoke to him about his journey, and why agronomists are essential to shaping AI in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One Youth Farmer, 15,000 Others Inspired</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/amos-spotlight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:48:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/amos-spotlight/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, digital agriculture is reshaping how young people see farming. Drones, climate apps, mobile advisory platforms are making agriculture look cool, profitable and modern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s working: the majority of digital agriculture users in Africa are aged 15–35, showing how technology is pulling a new generation back to farming. From Hello Tractor in Nigeria to DigiFarm in Kenya, young people are driving adoption. Projects like Hinga Weze in Rwanda and startups like M-Omulimisa in Uganda are proving the same thing: give youth the right tools, and they transform agriculture into a business worth staying in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Virtual Agronomist Reaches 250,000 Farmers: Scaling Real Solutions, Fast</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/250000-unique-farmers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:38:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/250000-unique-farmers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just one month ago, we announced that Virtual Agronomist had reached more than 250,000 farm plots with locally tailored, AI-powered advice. Today, that figure already looks out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve now passed 350,000 farm plots, and for the first time, we can say we are directly serving a quarter of a million farmers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more than a milestone. It’s evidence of huge, rapid growth — and of the power of a model that is working at scale, and in reality, for African farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Last Mile, First Priority: What It Takes to Get Tech to the Field</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/last-mile-first-priority-monalisa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:04:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/last-mile-first-priority-monalisa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Q&amp;amp;A with Monalisa Mutesi, iSDA’s Uganda Country Director&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The last mile is where change takes root. If you care about scale, you have to get your hands dirty and your boots muddy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monalisa Mutesi is the driving force behind iSDA’s work in Uganda — and a firm believer that the best agtech means nothing if it doesn’t work for farmers on the ground. As Uganda Country Director, she leads iSDA’s last-mile delivery work: connecting science to farmers, turning insights into impact and building partnerships that make scale real.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Beyond the Harvest: How Virtual Agronomist Is Doing More Than Improving Yields</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/doing-more-than-improving-yields/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:04:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/doing-more-than-improving-yields/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

— Dorcas Macharia, smallholder farmer, Reru&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, smallholder farmers face mounting challenges - unpredictable weather, rising input costs and limited access to expert guidance.
But change is underway, driven by a new generation of science-backed tools like iSDA’s Virtual Agronomist.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What If Every Farmer Could Diagnose Their Soil? Now They Can</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/know-your-soil-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 10:10:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/know-your-soil-release/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite extensive scientific effort in creating soil maps, they seldom reach farmers in a usable form.
Know Your Soil changes that by delivering tailored summaries of soil constraints for each field, together with clear, actionable management recommendations.
Farmers are also guided through simple on-farm observations to identify more subtle issues - such as structural limitations - and adapt their practices accordingly.
Accessible via WhatsApp through Virtual Agronomist, Know Your Soil serves as a practical learning resource for both farmers and extension agents.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Advice in Action: Virtual Agronomist Delivers Higher Yields for Ugandan Sunflower Farmers</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/uganda-sunflower-farmers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:33:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/uganda-sunflower-farmers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Uganda’s agricultural sector plays a vital role in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and ensuring national food security.
Contributing around 24% to GDP and employing over 70% of the population, agriculture is the country’s economic backbone.
Yet with most farming rain-fed and subsistence-based, the sector remains highly vulnerable to climate change - especially to increasingly frequent and severe droughts.
By 2050, climate impacts are projected to cause economic losses of up to US$1.5 billion for smallholder farmers across Africa. Their livelihoods - and national food systems - are under growing threat.
That’s why iSDA is building tools that combine world-class science with cutting-edge technology to help farmers adapt.
At the centre of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist"&gt;Virtual Agronomist (VA)&lt;/a&gt; - our AI-powered advisory tool, delivered via WhatsApp, that provides data-driven,
hyper-local advice to farmers across Africa. What makes VA different is its foundation in science: it generates fertiliser and nutrient management plans tailored to individual plots,
using high-resolution soil data from &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil"&gt;iSDAsoil&lt;/a&gt;, Africa’s most detailed soil mapping platform. By pairing soil diagnostics with real-time insights on pests, disease and weather,
Virtual Agronomist helps farmers make smarter decisions - boosting productivity and building resilience to climate shocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Science Still Matters in the Ai Era</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-science-still-matters-in-the-ai-era/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 11:30:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-science-still-matters-in-the-ai-era/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a world increasingly focused on artificial intelligence and digital solutions, Dr. Keith Shepherd has always been driven by one fundamental question: how can science truly serve farmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As iSDA’s Chief Scientist, Keith has spent decades building the tools and data systems that underpin modern agricultural decision-making in Africa. From co-leading the Africa Soil Information Service to pioneering the use of infrared spectroscopy for rapid, low-cost soil analysis, Keith’s work laid the foundation for iSDAsoil – Africa’s first high-resolution map of soil properties – now widely used by researchers, governments and farmers alike. But for Keith, data is only powerful when it leads to action.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why the Next Generation of Farm Advisory Needs More Than Just Cool Tech</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:58:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, millions of farmers face a fundamental challenge: they lack access to timely, tailored advice that can help them make confident decisions about their crops and soils.
This isn’t a new problem. What’s new is the tools at our disposal to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At iSDA, we believe the future of farm advisory is more than just tech. It’s about trust, science, systems - and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-more-tech-doesnt-automatically-mean-better-advice"&gt;1. More Tech Doesn’t Automatically Mean Better Advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we’ve seen a surge in AI-powered platforms promising to revolutionise smallholder agriculture. And yes - technology is unlocking new possibilities. But when tech is deployed without a deep understanding of agronomy, local context or farmer realities, it risks repeating old mistakes in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Virtual Agronomist: Notes from a Kenyan Software Engineer</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/notes-from-a-kenyan-software-engineer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 11:55:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/notes-from-a-kenyan-software-engineer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Meet Abi Wairimu, one of the brilliant minds behind Virtual Agronomist. Her
journey began with a passion for computer science and a belief that technology could

However, despite this, maize yield per hectare has often been significantly low, with farmers only averaging around 1.5 tonnes per hectare. Contributing factors to this low yield include drought brought about by climate change, pests and diseases, nutrient-deficient soils, and suboptimal agronomic practices. During our pilot programmes in the 2023/2024 season, iSDA partnered with IAPRI (Indaba Agricultural Policy Research Institute) to deliver tailored fertiliser recommendations to farmers in Zambia with an objective to increase maize yield by half and raise awareness of soil fertility levels across smallholder farms in the districts of Monze and Kapiri Mposhi.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Three Times More Yield for Tanzanian Farmers With Virtual Agronomist</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/tanzania-three-times-more-yield/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 12:51:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/tanzania-three-times-more-yield/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At iSDA, we have been seeing fantastic positive yield responses with &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/"&gt;Virtual Agronomist&lt;/a&gt; across a range of crops and countries, including maize in Côte D’Ivoire, barley and sorghum in Uganda, coffee in Kenya and rice in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable responses comes from sunflower and rice farmers in Tanzania whose crops are showing impressive yield results and offering positive predictions in growth and profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 we started a pilot programme in Tanzania with sunflower farmers in Singida, Iringa, Manyara and Dodoma with Pyxus International. Using Virtual Agronomist, our tailored advisory service, the Field Technicians generated specific nutrient recommendations for each farmer along with suggestions to improve agronomic practices. We demonstrated that the prospective yield and profit results with Virtual Agronomist were on average three times the farmer’s previous practice, when accompanied by good agronomic management.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>iSDAsoil used in malaria mapping study</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-07-28-isdasoil-malaria-mapping/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-07-28-isdasoil-malaria-mapping/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;iSDA’s soil and agronomy map iSDAsoil was recently used by scientists to create a framework to map the malaria exposure levels of Africans living in towns and cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though iSDAsoil is primarily used by iSDA as input for Virtual Agronomist, which determines the best use and combinations of fertilisers on their land, it also contains information on different chemical and physical soil properties that were used by these scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soil pH has an effect on the habitats of the Anopheles mosquito which transmits malaria. The scientists in this study therefore incorporated soil pH data to further determine the possible habitats of the mosquitoes. For this, they used open data from iSDAsoil at a depth of 0–20 cm.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sustain Africa - increasing access to affordable fertiliser at scale</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-06-22-sustain-africa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-06-22-sustain-africa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As fertiliser prices continued to spike due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, iSDA joined the &lt;a href="https://sustainafrica-initiative.org"&gt;Sustain Africa&lt;/a&gt; initiative in 2022 to increase African farmers&amp;rsquo; access to affordable fertiliser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great challenge when it comes to fertiliser use in Africa is the lack of precision in delivering the correct chemical formulation needed for each patch of farmland. Not all soils are formed or managed equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iSDA&amp;rsquo;s role in the Sustain Africa initiative has therefore been to deploy our app &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/"&gt;Virtual Agronomist&lt;/a&gt; to tackle this issue. The system was created to provide individual farmers in Africa, who usually do not have access to lab testing, the ability to assess the soil properties of their farmland and provide nutrient management plans for sustainable increases in crop yield.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CEO Announcement</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-06-08-ceo-announcement/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-06-08-ceo-announcement/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the iSDA Board and team, I am delighted to announce Jamie Collinson as our new Chief Executive Officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My background is that I’m a social scientist. I’m employed on this project as an environmental modeller. We’re most interested in Ethiopia, because there’s a lot of degraded land there. I think it is about a quarter of the land, which impacts about a third of the population.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>ASA Conference</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2021-02-18-asa-conference-10-11-november-2020/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2021 10:16:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2021-02-18-asa-conference-10-11-november-2020/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Notes from the Special symposium on Translating Visionary Science for Excellence in African Agronomy at The American Society of Agronomy (ASA), the Crop Science Society of America (CSSA), and the Soil Science Society of America (SSSA) International Annual Meeting. 10th to 11th November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil"&gt;iSDAsoil&lt;/a&gt; previously launched on 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; October 2020 and is an open access soil property map with 30m resolution for Africa. iSDA has collaborated with &lt;a href="https://www.worldagroforestry.org/"&gt;ICRAF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/"&gt;Rothamsted Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://envirometrix.nl/"&gt;Envirometrix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gilab.rs/"&gt;GiLab&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://multione.hr/home.html"&gt;MultiOne&lt;/a&gt; to gather the immense dataset which underpins this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using on-site soil samples and computer modelling, a detailed and interactive image is produced displaying multiple properties of the soil throughout Africa. The high resolution of the data (24 billion data points) means that a single farm can identify the soil type accurate to a particular field. iSDAsoil also takes into account the depth of soil and the type of underlying bedrock to predict the full picture of soil status across the country. Where there are data gaps, iSDAsoil will be improved upon with further data received from dedicated soil agronomists.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>International Fertilizer Association Webinar 26 February 2021</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2021-02-16-international-fertilizer-association-webinar-26-february-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 09:14:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2021-02-16-international-fertilizer-association-webinar-26-february-2021/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="an-information-revolution-in-africa-introducing-isdasoil"&gt;An information revolution in Africa?
