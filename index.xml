&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data has been prepared as cloud-optimised geoTIFFs (essentially geographically aware images). A single file covers the whole of Africa. Related data have been grouped together as bands in a single file. For most soil property predictions, this means that each file has 4 bands – the predicted mean value, and model error (expressed as 1 standard deviation) at 2 soil depths: 0-20cm and 20-50cm. For covariate data the number of bands is variable.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Month of Momentum</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/month-of-momentum/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:01:28 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/month-of-momentum/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By Bruce Kisitu, Director of Operations, Africa.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past month has been one of the most energising periods I’ve experienced in my time with iSDA. In the space of just a few weeks we had the privilege of engaging with some of the most important conversations shaping the future of African agriculture, while also witnessing the ever-growing tangible impact of our work on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Africa Food Systems Forum in Dakar, the energy in meeting rooms, panel discussions and exhibition halls was palpable. The urgency around food security, resilience and inclusive growth could not have been clearer. iSDA was proud to contribute a science-driven, tech perspective, demonstrating that scalable digital solutions are not a distant possibility - they are happening today. Our AI-advisory tool, Virtual Agronomist, has already been adopted by over 250,000 smallholder farmers, and, in recent weeks we have been seeing an extraordinary surge of around 4,000 new registrations every single day! These numbers are not just statistics - they represent households making more informed decisions, fields being managed with greater precision and harvests that have a better chance of withstanding climate uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>What Agronomists Can Teach AI — An Interview with Dr. Paul Chunga</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/paul-chunga-interview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 10:22:29 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/paul-chunga-interview/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence is often hailed as the future of farming. But without real agronomy - the science of crops, soils and farming systems - AI is just numbers. At iSDA, agronomists like Dr. Paul Chunga are making sure that Virtual Agronomist doesn’t just crunch data, but delivers advice that actually works for farmers in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Malawian agronomist with nearly a decade in CGIAR institutions, a PhD in agronomy and applied plant physiology, and now Senior Agronomist at iSDA, Dr. Chunga has dedicated his career to bridging science and practice. We spoke to him about his journey, and why agronomists are essential to shaping AI in agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>One Youth Farmer, 15,000 Others Inspired</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/amos-spotlight/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:48:10 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/amos-spotlight/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, digital agriculture is reshaping how young people see farming. Drones, climate apps, mobile advisory platforms are making agriculture look cool, profitable and modern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s working: the majority of digital agriculture users in Africa are aged 15–35, showing how technology is pulling a new generation back to farming. From Hello Tractor in Nigeria to DigiFarm in Kenya, young people are driving adoption. Projects like Hinga Weze in Rwanda and startups like M-Omulimisa in Uganda are proving the same thing: give youth the right tools, and they transform agriculture into a business worth staying in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Virtual Agronomist Reaches 250,000 Farmers: Scaling Real Solutions, Fast</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/250000-unique-farmers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:38:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/250000-unique-farmers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just one month ago, we announced that Virtual Agronomist had reached more than 250,000 farm plots with locally tailored, AI-powered advice.

Contributing around 24% to GDP and employing over 70% of the population, agriculture is the country’s economic backbone.
Yet with most farming rain-fed and subsistence-based, the sector remains highly vulnerable to climate change - especially to increasingly frequent and severe droughts.
By 2050, climate impacts are projected to cause economic losses of up to US$1.5 billion for smallholder farmers across Africa. Their livelihoods - and national food systems - are under growing threat.
That’s why iSDA is building tools that combine world-class science with cutting-edge technology to help farmers adapt.
At the centre of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist"&gt;Virtual Agronomist (VA)&lt;/a&gt; - our AI-powered advisory tool, delivered via WhatsApp, that provides data-driven,
hyper-local advice to farmers across Africa. What makes VA different is its foundation in science: it generates fertiliser and nutrient management plans tailored to individual plots,
using high-resolution soil data from &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil"&gt;iSDAsoil&lt;/a&gt;, Africa’s most detailed soil mapping platform. By pairing soil diagnostics with real-time insights on pests, disease and weather,

&lt;p&gt;As iSDA’s Chief Scientist, Keith has spent decades building the tools and data systems that underpin modern agricultural decision-making in Africa. From co-leading the Africa Soil Information Service to pioneering the use of infrared spectroscopy for rapid, low-cost soil analysis, Keith’s work laid the foundation for iSDAsoil – Africa’s first high-resolution map of soil properties – now widely used by researchers, governments and farmers alike. But for Keith, data is only powerful when it leads to action.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why the Next Generation of Farm Advisory Needs More Than Just Cool Tech</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:58:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, millions of farmers face a fundamental challenge: they lack access to timely, tailored advice that can help them make confident decisions about their crops and soils.
This isn’t a new problem. What’s new is the tools at our disposal to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At iSDA, we believe the future of farm advisory is more than just tech. It’s about trust, science, systems - and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-more-tech-doesnt-automatically-mean-better-advice"&gt;1. More Tech Doesn’t Automatically Mean Better Advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we’ve seen a surge in AI-powered platforms promising to revolutionise smallholder agriculture. And yes - technology is unlocking new possibilities. But when tech is deployed without a deep understanding of agronomy, local context or farmer realities, it risks repeating old mistakes in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Non-Executive Director</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/careers/board/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/careers/board/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;iSDA is redefining what’s possible in African agriculture.

However, despite this, maize yield per hectare has often been significantly low, with farmers only averaging around 1.5 tonnes per hectare. Contributing factors to this low yield include drought brought about by climate change, pests and diseases, nutrient-deficient soils, and suboptimal agronomic practices. During our pilot programmes in the 2023/2024 season, iSDA partnered with IAPRI (Indaba Agricultural Policy Research Institute) to deliver tailored fertiliser recommendations to farmers in Zambia with an objective to increase maize yield by half and raise awareness of soil fertility levels across smallholder farms in the districts of Monze and Kapiri Mposhi.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Three Times More Yield for Tanzanian Farmers With Virtual Agronomist</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/tanzania-three-times-more-yield/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 12:51:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/tanzania-three-times-more-yield/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At iSDA, we have been seeing fantastic positive yield responses with &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/"&gt;Virtual Agronomist&lt;/a&gt; across a range of crops and countries, including maize in Côte D’Ivoire, barley and sorghum in Uganda, coffee in Kenya and rice in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable responses comes from sunflower and rice farmers in Tanzania whose crops are showing impressive yield results and offering positive predictions in growth and profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 we started a pilot programme in Tanzania with sunflower farmers in Singida, Iringa, Manyara and Dodoma with Pyxus International. Using Virtual Agronomist, our tailored advisory service, the Field Technicians generated specific nutrient recommendations for each farmer along with suggestions to improve agronomic practices.

&lt;p&gt;Though iSDAsoil is primarily used by iSDA as input for Virtual Agronomist, which determines the best use and combinations of fertilisers on their land, it also contains information on different chemical and physical soil properties that were used by these scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soil pH has an effect on the habitats of the Anopheles mosquito which transmits malaria.

A partnership of the &lt;a href="https://www.precisioncropnutrition.net"&gt;Consortium for Precision Crop Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, global research institutes and agtech companies like iSDA, the first outputs will be two databases focused on crop nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The databases will serve as a valuable open resource for agriculturual researchers and those in industry conducting field trials on soil fertility and crop nutrition. Users can both contribute to and benefit from the shared datasets, allowing critical data to be shared amongst researchers and commercial companies. The databases have already produced rapid results, including a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108578"&gt;published paper&lt;/a&gt; that estimates nutrient use and storage in maize.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>iSDA exhibiting at AGRF Summit, Kigali</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-04-isda-at-agrf-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 08:46:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-04-isda-at-agrf-2022/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="grow-nourish-reward---bold-actions-for-resilient-food-systems"&gt;Grow.

&lt;p&gt;Using on-site soil samples and computer modelling, a detailed and interactive image is produced displaying multiple properties of the soil throughout Africa. The high resolution of the data (24 billion data points) means that a single farm can identify the soil type accurate to a particular field. iSDAsoil also takes into account the depth of soil and the type of underlying bedrock to predict the full picture of soil status across the country. Where there are data gaps, iSDAsoil will be improved upon with further data received from dedicated soil agronomists.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>International Fertilizer Association Webinar 26 February 2021</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2021-02-16-international-fertilizer-association-webinar-26-february-2021/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 09:14:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2021-02-16-international-fertilizer-association-webinar-26-february-2021/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="an-information-revolution-in-africa-introducing-isdasoil"&gt;An information revolution in Africa?

&lt;p&gt;Farming anywhere is typified by high investment risks, due to uncertainties in weather, pests and diseases, labour availability, responses to inputs, market prices, and climate change, to name a few. Risks are particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa smallholder systems due to large spatial and temporal variability in all these factors, coupled with large impacts due to low incomes, vulnerable households, and the high price of inputs. High decision risk also stifles adoption of improved practices. The scarcity of reliable data further impairs delivering sound agronomic advisory to reduce decision risk. And yet current agronomic advice fails to communicate risk to farmers, or to help them learn how to reduce risks or promote opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Diagnostics</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/science/diagnostics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/science/diagnostics/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;iSDA is committed to diagnosing yield and profit limiting constraints. We do this at an individual field level to help farmers prioritise their investments, and at a project level to help aggregators target support services to farmers. Our applications help field officers quantitatively assess a wide range of yield constraints, ranging from plant nutrient deficiencies to soil structural constraints, and offer solutions for overcoming them. The constraints are diagnosed through observable indicators, in some cases with follow-up laboratory analyses. iSDA’s Bayesian approach provides for updating of our models over time based on observed cases and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Scientific publications</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/science/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/science/publications/</guid><description>&lt;div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;iSDA&amp;rsquo;s Chief Scientist, Keith Shepherd, pioneered the use of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for soil and plant analysis in Africa from the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s and has developed several global soil spectral libraries (see references below). He has helped establish soil spectroscopy in over 20 African laboratories, as well as in India, UK and USA.He has led the development of the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soisec.2022.100061"&gt;Global Soil Spectral Library and Estimation Service&lt;/a&gt;, which aims to provide a free resource for estimating soil properties from anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Spatial Agronomy</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/science/spatial-agronomy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/science/spatial-agronomy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Open access geospatial datasets are what underpin iSDA&amp;rsquo;s approach to Spatial Agronomy. Satellites are constantly monitoring the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface, allowing us to understand what is currently happening in any field. Many satellite missions have been orbiting the Earth for a long time - since the 1970&amp;rsquo;s, in the case of the Landsat missions. This means we can see how a field has been managed in the past few decades. We are also able to peer into the future using weather forecasts. Bringing all of this information together can help agronomists monitor their fields.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Virtual Agronomist Privacy Policy</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist-privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist-privacy-policy/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
