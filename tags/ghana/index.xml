This initiative is more than a project â€“ it is a shared vision for empowering smallholder farmers with the knowledge they need to improve their livelihoods through smarter, data-driven farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sesi Technologies provides technology solutions to help African farmers and agribusinesses to boost productivity, minimise losses and enhance their earnings. Since 2018, the company has delivered products and services that have positively impacted the lives of over 2,000 farmers and agribusinesses in Ghana and beyond, collaborating with the World Food Programme and other international partners to work to create a better life for farmers through innovative technology solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
