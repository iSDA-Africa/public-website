These data are analysis-ready and do not require any preprocessing before usage. The dataset was collected and analysed according to protocols created by the African Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project (&lt;a href="https://worldagroforestry.org/sites/default/files/afsisSoilHealthTechSpecs_v1_smaller.pdf">VÃ¥gen T-G et al., 2010&lt;/a>). AfSIS was an initiative funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at improving soil information across Africa. Data were collected and analysed between 2008 and 2020. In total, over 50,000 soil samples were collected across more than 15 countries.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Launch of Global Crop Nutrient Databases</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-05-global-crop-nutrient-databases-launched/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 12:17:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-05-global-crop-nutrient-databases-launched/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 6th September 2022 a landmark new &lt;a href="https://cropnutrientdata.net">open data crop nutrition platform&lt;/a> will launch. A partnership of the &lt;a href="https://www.precisioncropnutrition.net">Consortium for Precision Crop Nutrition&lt;/a>, global research institutes and agtech companies like iSDA, the first outputs will be two databases focused on crop nutrition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The databases will serve as a valuable open resource for agriculturual researchers and those in industry conducting field trials on soil fertility and crop nutrition. Users can both contribute to and benefit from the shared datasets, allowing critical data to be shared amongst researchers and commercial companies. The databases have already produced rapid results, including a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108578">published paper&lt;/a> that estimates nutrient use and storage in maize.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
