Poor agronomic practices, pests, diseases, low-yielding varieties and unstable market prices have contributed to low production. iSDA&amp;rsquo;s Virtual Agronomist (VA) leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support smallholder farmers with farm-specific agronomic advice. Virtual Agronomist is a scientific AI tool that is delivered through a WhatsApp chatbot and advises farmers on fertiliser, pests, diseases, weather and soils. It is offered for more than 20 crops, including coffee. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unveiling the Impact of iSDA's Rice Harvest Data Survey in Mwea, Kenya</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/unveiling-the-impact-of-isda-rice-harvest-data-survey-in-mwea/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2025 14:16:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/unveiling-the-impact-of-isda-rice-harvest-data-survey-in-mwea/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Rice production is central to Mwea’s agricultural identity, contributing significantly to Kenya’s food security and economy while supporting thousands of smallholder farmers. However, challenges such as resource inefficiencies, soil degradation, and the need for precise farming practices make it difficult to meet growing demands sustainably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle these issues, our team at iSDA conducted a retrospective cohort study to assess the impact of our &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/"&gt;Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service&lt;/a&gt; compared with normal Farmer Practice in the Mwea Rice Scheme in Kenya. Designed to deliver tailored, data-driven recommendations, our Virtual Agronomist advisory service aims to enhance farming practices and boost productivity for farmers across Africa.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>iSDA releases a large soil analysis dataset for Africa</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-03-16-soil-data-release/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-03-16-soil-data-release/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;ISDA is proud to release a large dataset of analysed soil samples covering the African continent. These data are analysis-ready and do not require any preprocessing before usage. The dataset was collected and analysed according to protocols created by the African Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project (&lt;a href="https://worldagroforestry.org/sites/default/files/afsisSoilHealthTechSpecs_v1_smaller.pdf"&gt;Vågen T-G et al., 2010&lt;/a&gt;). AfSIS was an initiative funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, aimed at improving soil information across Africa. Data were collected and analysed between 2008 and 2020. In total, over 50,000 soil samples were collected across more than 15 countries.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Launch of Global Crop Nutrient Databases</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-05-global-crop-nutrient-databases-launched/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Sep 2022 12:17:27 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-05-global-crop-nutrient-databases-launched/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;On 6th September 2022 a landmark new &lt;a href="https://cropnutrientdata.net"&gt;open data crop nutrition platform&lt;/a&gt; will launch. A partnership of the &lt;a href="https://www.precisioncropnutrition.net"&gt;Consortium for Precision Crop Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, global research institutes and agtech companies like iSDA, the first outputs will be two databases focused on crop nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The databases will serve as a valuable open resource for agriculturual researchers and those in industry conducting field trials on soil fertility and crop nutrition. Users can both contribute to and benefit from the shared datasets, allowing critical data to be shared amongst researchers and commercial companies. The databases have already produced rapid results, including a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108578"&gt;published paper&lt;/a&gt; that estimates nutrient use and storage in maize.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
