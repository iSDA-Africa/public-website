&lt;p>&lt;em>“Last year’s income was quite high, so I decided to build a good house for me to live in, and this is what I am working on finalising.”&lt;/em>
— Dorcas Macharia, smallholder farmer, Reru&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Across Africa, smallholder farmers face mounting challenges - unpredictable weather, rising input costs and limited access to expert guidance.
But change is underway, driven by a new generation of science-backed tools like iSDA’s Virtual Agronomist.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What If Every Farmer Could Diagnose Their Soil? Now They Can</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/know-your-soil-release/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 10:10:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/know-your-soil-release/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Despite extensive scientific effort in creating soil maps, they seldom reach farmers in a usable form.
Know Your Soil changes that by delivering tailored summaries of soil constraints for each field, together with clear, actionable management recommendations.
Farmers are also guided through simple on-farm observations to identify more subtle issues - such as structural limitations - and adapt their practices accordingly.
Accessible via WhatsApp through Virtual Agronomist, Know Your Soil serves as a practical learning resource for both farmers and extension agents.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Advice in Action: Virtual Agronomist Delivers Higher Yields for Ugandan Sunflower Farmers</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/uganda-sunflower-farmers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:33:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/uganda-sunflower-farmers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Uganda’s agricultural sector plays a vital role in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and ensuring national food security.
Contributing around 24% to GDP and employing over 70% of the population, agriculture is the country’s economic backbone.
Yet with most farming rain-fed and subsistence-based, the sector remains highly vulnerable to climate change - especially to increasingly frequent and severe droughts.
By 2050, climate impacts are projected to cause economic losses of up to US$1.5 billion for smallholder farmers across Africa. Their livelihoods - and national food systems - are under growing threat.
That’s why iSDA is building tools that combine world-class science with cutting-edge technology to help farmers adapt.
At the centre of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist">Virtual Agronomist (VA)&lt;/a> - our AI-powered advisory tool, delivered via WhatsApp, that provides data-driven,
hyper-local advice to farmers across Africa. What makes VA different is its foundation in science: it generates fertiliser and nutrient management plans tailored to individual plots,
using high-resolution soil data from &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil">iSDAsoil&lt;/a>, Africa’s most detailed soil mapping platform. By pairing soil diagnostics with real-time insights on pests, disease and weather,
Virtual Agronomist helps farmers make smarter decisions - boosting productivity and building resilience to climate shocks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why the Next Generation of Farm Advisory Needs More Than Just Cool Tech</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:58:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</guid><description>&lt;p>Across Africa, millions of farmers face a fundamental challenge: they lack access to timely, tailored advice that can help them make confident decisions about their crops and soils.
This isn’t a new problem. What’s new is the tools at our disposal to solve it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At iSDA, we believe the future of farm advisory is more than just tech. It’s about trust, science, systems - and scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-more-tech-doesnt-automatically-mean-better-advice">1. More Tech Doesn’t Automatically Mean Better Advice&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In recent years, we’ve seen a surge in AI-powered platforms promising to revolutionise smallholder agriculture. And yes - technology is unlocking new possibilities. But when tech is deployed without a deep understanding of agronomy, local context or farmer realities, it risks repeating old mistakes in new ways.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>200,000 Plots and Counting: Celebrating One Year of Our Virtual Agronomist AI Advisory Service</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/virtual-agronomist-one-year/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Mar 2025 16:50:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/virtual-agronomist-one-year/</guid><description>&lt;p>In its first year, our &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/">Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service&lt;/a> has provided tailored nutrient recommendations for over 200,000 farm plots across Africa.

&lt;p>One of the most notable responses comes from sunflower and rice farmers in Tanzania whose crops are showing impressive yield results and offering positive predictions in growth and profit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2022 we started a pilot programme in Tanzania with sunflower farmers in Singida, Iringa, Manyara and Dodoma with Pyxus International. Using Virtual Agronomist, our tailored advisory service, the Field Technicians generated specific nutrient recommendations for each farmer along with suggestions to improve agronomic practices. We demonstrated that the prospective yield and profit results with Virtual Agronomist were on average three times the farmer’s previous practice, when accompanied by good agronomic management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sustain Africa - increasing access to affordable fertiliser at scale</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-06-22-sustain-africa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2023-06-22-sustain-africa/</guid><description>&lt;p>As fertiliser prices continued to spike due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, iSDA joined the &lt;a href="https://sustainafrica-initiative.org">Sustain Africa&lt;/a> initiative in 2022 to increase African farmers&amp;rsquo; access to affordable fertiliser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A great challenge when it comes to fertiliser use in Africa is the lack of precision in delivering the correct chemical formulation needed for each patch of farmland. Not all soils are formed or managed equally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>iSDA&amp;rsquo;s role in the Sustain Africa initiative has therefore been to deploy our app &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/">Virtual Agronomist&lt;/a> to tackle this issue. The system was created to provide individual farmers in Africa, who usually do not have access to lab testing, the ability to assess the soil properties of their farmland and provide nutrient management plans for sustainable increases in crop yield.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iSDA exhibiting at AGRF Summit, Kigali</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-04-isda-at-agrf-2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Sep 2022 08:46:11 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/2022-09-04-isda-at-agrf-2022/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="grow-nourish-reward---bold-actions-for-resilient-food-systems">Grow.
