Drones, climate apps, mobile advisory platforms are making agriculture look cool, profitable and modern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s working: the majority of digital agriculture users in Africa are aged 15–35, showing how technology is pulling a new generation back to farming. From Hello Tractor in Nigeria to DigiFarm in Kenya, young people are driving adoption. Projects like Hinga Weze in Rwanda and startups like M-Omulimisa in Uganda are proving the same thing: give youth the right tools, and they transform agriculture into a business worth staying in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Virtual Agronomist Reaches 250,000 Farmers: Scaling Real Solutions, Fast</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/250000-unique-farmers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 18:38:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/250000-unique-farmers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Just one month ago, we announced that Virtual Agronomist had reached more than 250,000 farm plots with locally tailored, AI-powered advice. Today, that figure already looks out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve now passed 350,000 farm plots, and for the first time, we can say we are directly serving a quarter of a million farmers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more than a milestone. It’s evidence of huge, rapid growth — and of the power of a model that is working at scale, and in reality, for African farmers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Last Mile, First Priority: What It Takes to Get Tech to the Field</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/last-mile-first-priority-monalisa/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 13:04:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/last-mile-first-priority-monalisa/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Q&amp;amp;A with Monalisa Mutesi, iSDA’s Uganda Country Director&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The last mile is where change takes root. If you care about scale, you have to get your hands dirty and your boots muddy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monalisa Mutesi is the driving force behind iSDA’s work in Uganda — and a firm believer that the best agtech means nothing if it doesn’t work for farmers on the ground. As Uganda Country Director, she leads iSDA’s last-mile delivery work: connecting science to farmers, turning insights into impact and building partnerships that make scale real.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Beyond the Harvest: How Virtual Agronomist Is Doing More Than Improving Yields</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/doing-more-than-improving-yields/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:04:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/doing-more-than-improving-yields/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Last year’s income was quite high, so I decided to build a good house for me to live in, and this is what I am working on finalising.”&lt;/em&gt;
— Dorcas Macharia, smallholder farmer, Reru&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, smallholder farmers face mounting challenges - unpredictable weather, rising input costs and limited access to expert guidance.
But change is underway, driven by a new generation of science-backed tools like iSDA’s Virtual Agronomist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-virtual-agronomist-works"&gt;How Virtual Agronomist Works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtual Agronomist delivers personalised, expert advice via WhatsApp, tailored to each farmer’s soil,
crop and weather conditions. It guides decisions on fertiliser use, pest control and planting schedules - combining local data with cutting-edge science.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>AI Advice in Action: Virtual Agronomist Delivers Higher Yields for Ugandan Sunflower Farmers</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/uganda-sunflower-farmers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jul 2025 16:33:58 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/uganda-sunflower-farmers/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Uganda’s agricultural sector plays a vital role in driving economic growth, reducing poverty and ensuring national food security.
Contributing around 24% to GDP and employing over 70% of the population, agriculture is the country’s economic backbone.
Yet with most farming rain-fed and subsistence-based, the sector remains highly vulnerable to climate change - especially to increasingly frequent and severe droughts.
By 2050, climate impacts are projected to cause economic losses of up to US$1.5 billion for smallholder farmers across Africa. Their livelihoods - and national food systems - are under growing threat.
That’s why iSDA is building tools that combine world-class science with cutting-edge technology to help farmers adapt.
At the centre of this work is &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist"&gt;Virtual Agronomist (VA)&lt;/a&gt; - our AI-powered advisory tool, delivered via WhatsApp, that provides data-driven,
hyper-local advice to farmers across Africa. What makes VA different is its foundation in science: it generates fertiliser and nutrient management plans tailored to individual plots,
using high-resolution soil data from &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/isdasoil"&gt;iSDAsoil&lt;/a&gt;, Africa’s most detailed soil mapping platform. By pairing soil diagnostics with real-time insights on pests, disease and weather,
Virtual Agronomist helps farmers make smarter decisions - boosting productivity and building resilience to climate shocks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why Science Still Matters in the Ai Era</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-science-still-matters-in-the-ai-era/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2025 11:30:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-science-still-matters-in-the-ai-era/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;In a world increasingly focused on artificial intelligence and digital solutions, Dr. Keith Shepherd has always been driven by one fundamental question: how can science truly serve farmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As iSDA’s Chief Scientist, Keith has spent decades building the tools and data systems that underpin modern agricultural decision-making in Africa. From co-leading the Africa Soil Information Service to pioneering the use of infrared spectroscopy for rapid, low-cost soil analysis, Keith’s work laid the foundation for iSDAsoil – Africa’s first high-resolution map of soil properties – now widely used by researchers, governments and farmers alike. But for Keith, data is only powerful when it leads to action.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why the Next Generation of Farm Advisory Needs More Than Just Cool Tech</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 15:58:43 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/why-the-next-generation-of-farm-advisory-needs-more-than-just-cool-tech/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Across Africa, millions of farmers face a fundamental challenge: they lack access to timely, tailored advice that can help them make confident decisions about their crops and soils.
This isn’t a new problem. What’s new is the tools at our disposal to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At iSDA, we believe the future of farm advisory is more than just tech. It’s about trust, science, systems - and scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1-more-tech-doesnt-automatically-mean-better-advice"&gt;1. More Tech Doesn’t Automatically Mean Better Advice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we’ve seen a surge in AI-powered platforms promising to revolutionise smallholder agriculture. And yes - technology is unlocking new possibilities. But when tech is deployed without a deep understanding of agronomy, local context or farmer realities, it risks repeating old mistakes in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Building Virtual Agronomist: Notes from a Kenyan Software Engineer</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/notes-from-a-kenyan-software-engineer/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2025 11:55:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/notes-from-a-kenyan-software-engineer/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Meet Abi Wairimu, one of the brilliant minds behind Virtual Agronomist.

&lt;p&gt;Unlike our previous mobile application, our new generation of Virtual Agronomist uses artificial intelligence to communicate directly with farmers through WhatsApp and provide tailored nutrient plans and other agronomic advice for their plots. In February 2024, we launched our AI chatbot service in Kenya and Uganda for rice and maize to help farmers improve their yields and profits through better agronomic management. We wanted farmers to be able to have this vital agricultural information at their fingertips without common barriers, such as expensive land surveyor costs and lack of modern phone technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Promising Future Yield Responses With Virtual Agronomist in Zambia</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/promising-future-yield-responses-with-virtual-agronomist-in-zambia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 13:01:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/promising-future-yield-responses-with-virtual-agronomist-in-zambia/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Maize is a staple food for over half of the Zambian population and is cultivated by around eighty percent of smallholder farmers in the country. However, despite this, maize yield per hectare has often been significantly low, with farmers only averaging around 1.5 tonnes per hectare. Contributing factors to this low yield include drought brought about by climate change, pests and diseases, nutrient-deficient soils, and suboptimal agronomic practices. During our pilot programmes in the 2023/2024 season, iSDA partnered with IAPRI (Indaba Agricultural Policy Research Institute) to deliver tailored fertiliser recommendations to farmers in Zambia with an objective to increase maize yield by half and raise awareness of soil fertility levels across smallholder farms in the districts of Monze and Kapiri Mposhi.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Three Times More Yield for Tanzanian Farmers With Virtual Agronomist</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/tanzania-three-times-more-yield/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Apr 2024 12:51:32 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/tanzania-three-times-more-yield/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;At iSDA, we have been seeing fantastic positive yield responses with &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/"&gt;Virtual Agronomist&lt;/a&gt; across a range of crops and countries, including maize in Côte D’Ivoire, barley and sorghum in Uganda, coffee in Kenya and rice in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most notable responses comes from sunflower and rice farmers in Tanzania whose crops are showing impressive yield results and offering positive predictions in growth and profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022 we started a pilot programme in Tanzania with sunflower farmers in Singida, Iringa, Manyara and Dodoma with Pyxus International. Using Virtual Agronomist, our tailored advisory service, the Field Technicians generated specific nutrient recommendations for each farmer along with suggestions to improve agronomic practices. We demonstrated that the prospective yield and profit results with Virtual Agronomist were on average three times the farmer’s previous practice, when accompanied by good agronomic management.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
