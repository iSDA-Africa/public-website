&lt;p>As part of this partnership, we will deploy our &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/">Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service&lt;/a> to provide maize, soybean, and rice farmers with real-time, data-driven insights and advice to enhance crop management and increase yields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our service will provide personalised recommendations for essential agricultural practices, including fertiliser application and pest control, tailored to the unique conditions of each farm and will assist the farmers in improving their soil health by identifying nutritional deficiencies and suggesting the application of the correct nutrient balance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
