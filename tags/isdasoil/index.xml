      <description>iSDAsoil previously launched on 23rd October 2020 and is an open access soil property map with 30m resolution for Africa. iSDA has collaborated with ICRAF, Rothamsted Research, Envirometrix, GiLab, and MultiOne to gather the immense dataset which underpins this work.&#xA;Using on-site soil samples and computer modelling, a detailed and interactive image is produced displaying multiple properties of the soil throughout Africa. The high resolution of the data (24 billion data points) means that a single farm can identify the soil type accurate to a particular field.</description>
