At the recent CPCN seminar, our innovative &lt;a href="https://www.isda-africa.com/virtual-agronomist/"&gt;Virtual Agronomist AI advisory service&lt;/a&gt; took center stage. This cutting-edge tool delivers personalised agronomic advice directly to farmers via WhatsApp, bridging the gap between scientific insights and on-the-ground farming practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.precisioncropnutrition.net"&gt;Consortium for Precision Crop Nutrition (CPCN)&lt;/a&gt; seminar is coordinated by Dr Canon Engoke, Senior Scientist at the &lt;a href="https://www.apni.net"&gt;African Plant Nutrition Institute&lt;/a&gt; based in Nairobi, Kenya. The CPCN serves as a dynamic platform where companies, research institutes, universities, NGOs, and national programs collaborate to share expertise and data. It fosters the co-creation of aligned crop nutrition principles, standards, algorithms, and other vital resources. The seminar provides a hub for innovation, aiming to accelerate the development of effective, evidence-based digital crop nutrition advisory solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Showcasing Virtual Agronomist at the 3rd African Conference on Precision Agriculture</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 16:09:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;We were thrilled to make a significant impact at the &lt;a href="https://paafrica.org"&gt;3rd African Conference of Precision Agriculture (AfCPA)&lt;/a&gt;, held in Marrakech, Morocco, from December 3rd to 5th, 2024.
