The CPCN serves as a dynamic platform where companies, research institutes, universities, NGOs, and national programs collaborate to share expertise and data. It fosters the co-creation of aligned crop nutrition principles, standards, algorithms, and other vital resources. The seminar provides a hub for innovation, aiming to accelerate the development of effective, evidence-based digital crop nutrition advisory solutions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Showcasing Virtual Agronomist at the 3rd African Conference on Precision Agriculture</title><link>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Dec 2024 16:09:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.isda-africa.com/posts/showcasing-virtual-agronomist-at-the-3rd-african-conference-on-precision-agriculture/</guid><description>&lt;p>We were thrilled to make a significant impact at the &lt;a href="https://paafrica.org">3rd African Conference of Precision Agriculture (AfCPA)&lt;/a>, held in Marrakech, Morocco, from December 3rd to 5th, 2024.
