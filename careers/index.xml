We’re the organisation behind Virtual Agronomist - Africa’s fastest-growing AI-powered
advisory platform - built to boost the incomes and resilience of millions of small-scale
farmers. With science at our core and scale as our goal, we’re delivering expert, hyperlocal
advice to farmers across the continent - at a fraction of the cost of traditional extension
services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since launching Virtual Agronomist in 2024, we’ve reached over 250,000 farmers across
multiple countries - with proven impact on yields and profitability. Our diverse and ambitious
team operates across Africa and Europe, and we’re just getting started.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
