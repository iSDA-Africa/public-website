Welcome to this brief guide on the work behind our mapping technology. We hope it will give you a good understanding of the unique process we’ve developed to create our maps. For detailed information on our workflow, please read our paper in Nature Scientific Reports.
Our key output is spatial predictions of crucial soil nutrients and properties, based on the predictive soil mapping (PSM) techniques. The first step in this process is to standardise all the input soil data by i) ensuring all measured units are in the same format; ii) harmonizing properties measured using different techniques; and iii) removing any erroneous datapoints.</description></item><item><title>iSDAsoil on the AWS Registry of Open Data</title><link>https://isda-africa.github.io/public-website/isdasoil/isdasoil-on-aws/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 12:50:33 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://isda-africa.github.io/public-website/isdasoil/isdasoil-on-aws/</guid><description>Background This page contains information about how to access the iSDAsoil data hosted on the AWS Registry of Open Data, as well as background information about the dataset that will help you to use it.
